Project - Codroo
    
    Project Codroo is an application in which users create environments and define groups of users that exchange messages inside that environment.
    Environments are called "codroos". The owner creates a codroo and defines groups and access rights for each group. 
    
    The owner can:
        - create a codroo
        - create groups inside that codroo
        - add/remove users to groups
        - define default groups (groups that can be joined automatically)
        - define groups that have a default icon/text/style
        - define formulas for ranking messages

    Members of a group can:
        - post messages
        - delete messages
        - change icons
        - add/remove users to other groups
        - promote messages (feature similar to upvotes on reddit.com)
   
   Users can:
        - subscribe to codroos (become members of a default group) and have quick access to that codroo
        - subscribe to messages (replies to a subscribed message appear as nwe items)
        - bookmark a message
        - add friends
        - change profile icon
